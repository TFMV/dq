## About the Article

This article explores the parallels between DQOps' approach to documentation and data quality. It examines how a design-first philosophy produces systems that are more coherent, more usable, and ultimately more valuable - whether those systems are documentation or data quality tools.

The core premise is that documentation shouldn't be an afterthought, but rather a designed experience that mirrors the thoughtfulness of the product itself. DQOps exemplifies this approach with its well-structured documentation that serves as both guide and interface.

## Publication

The final article is intended for publication on Medium.
